# Frequently Asked Questions

## What's the source-data used for this SDK?

This SDK is generated [from the Azure API Definitions located within the `Azure/azure-rest-api-specs` repository](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs).

## Which Services are Available?

At this time only support Resource Manager Services are supported - the services supported [can be found in the `./resource-manager` directory](../resource-manager).

Data Plane services may be added to this repository in the future, but [for the moment can be found in `tombuildsstuff/kermit`](https://github.com/tombuildsstuff/kermit) - which makes use of the `Azure/go-autorest` base layer. 

## How can I request a new Service / API Version?

This SDK is generated by `hashicorp/pandora`, which [consumes the Azure API Definitions from the `Azure/azure-rest-api-specs` repository](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs) - the Services and API Versions which should be imported are [defined in this file](https://github.com/hashicorp/pandora/blob/main/config/resource-manager.hcl) - as such sending a Pull Request to update this file to include the new API Version will enable this to get generated.

More detailed information on how to add a new Service/API Version [can be found in this file](https://github.com/hashicorp/pandora/blob/main/docs/resource-manager-service-import.md) - however alternatively please feel free to open an issue requesting this.

## I think I've found a bug in the SDK, where should I report it?

We'd really appreciate it if you'd [open a new GitHub Issue](https://github.com/hashicorp/go-azure-sdk/issues/new/choose) so that we can take a look.

Since we release new versions of the SDK fairly often, it'd be helpful to know:

1. Which version of the SDK you're using.
2. Which Service / API Version combination you're using.
3. An example snippet highlighting the issue.
4. Debug logs (if available).

## How is this SDK versioned?

New versions of this SDK are released as required - and are [based on the Azure API Definitions located within the `Azure/azure-rest-api-specs` repository](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs).

We follow the version strategy `v0.YYYYMMDD.1HHmmSS` (for example for an SDK released on `2022-06-30` at `09:30:00`, we'll use the version `v0.20220630.1093000`).
